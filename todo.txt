Planned Feature Implementation
- Weapon Seed Improvements / Redesign**
- Better Debugging & Logging**
- Save preferences to file 
- Non-Consle Based UI
- Minimize (& eventually remove) use of tempInt / tempBool / tempString
	- stats.cpp:     / tempInt: 351 / tempBool: 25 / tempString: 133 /
	- stats.hpp:    / tempInt: 2   / tempBool: 1  / tempString: 1   /
	- weapon.cpp:  / tempInt: 96  / tempBool: 3  / tempString: 4   /
	- weapon.hpp: / tempInt: 1   / tempBool: 1  / tempString: 1   /
- Make Stat Selection efficent (Maybe put remaining stats in a multidimensional array updated via the statsUsed array)
- Fix crash errors:
	- One somewhere in the downside stat for meters 
	- One somewhere in SF#14
- Fix infinite loops
	- wl1
	- wl$d
- Fix other bugs
	- $d dynamic stat seen to not clear dStat values correctly (clears stats when not supposed to), results in multiple of the same stat value in final stats (ex. crit damage resist & 2 crit damage vulnerabilities in 1 weapon)
	- Unused values being added to dStat $s (maybe?)
 	- Auto-format fucked stats.cpp </3
	- $c val storage messed up for downsides
  - "std::out_of_range" during meter creation
	- "On Hit: drop health pack"'s rating is glithced
	- Tweak Stats
		- Bump up vaxx uber & bubble ratings
		- Make knockback have very tiny rating on hitscan
		- Increase ratingmod for rapid fire damage bonus
