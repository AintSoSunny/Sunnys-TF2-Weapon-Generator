# TF2-Weapon-Generator
A Team Fortress 2 weapon generator built from the ground up in C++.
This generator tries to make semi-balanced weapons using a rating system, but it doesn't always work, especially now because its incomplete and still needs more stats and features such as a stat blacklist preventing cearten weapons and classes from having a stat, all will be implemented eventually though, as I want to put in all the stats from the base game first.
